# React Weather App
Desktop app built in ReactJS that provides current, 5-day, and hourly weather data.

## Motivation
This project is my first practice with this JavaScript library, having gone through the basic study of React. It provided a good challenge in implementing and manipulating API with the Context API, React hooks and custom hooks.
